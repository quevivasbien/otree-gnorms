<p>We're now ready for Part 2 of the study. You will again see the profiles of {{ participant.vars.apps_per_emp }} applicants, just like in Part 1, except this time your task will be to guess the number of <em>job performance</em> questions that the applicant correctly answered.</p>

<p>To determine your bonus payment for this part, we'll randomly select one of your guesses, and if it is within <em>1</em> of the correct number, you'll receive a bonus payment of $1.00.</p>

<p>Complete the following statement to check your understanding before continuing:</p>
