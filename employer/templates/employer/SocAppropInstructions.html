<p>You are now ready for Part 3 (the final part) of the study. Like the previous parts you'll see the portfolios of {{ participant.vars.apps_per_emp }} applicants, and this time your task is to indicate how <em>socially appropriate</em> you think each applicants' responses are.</p>

<p>By “socially appropriate”, we mean behavior that most people agree is “reasonable” or “correct,” and consistent with proper social behavior in that context. By “socially inappropriate”, we mean behavior that most people agree will make them form a negative impression of the applicant.</p>

<p>To determine your bonus payment from this part, we'll randomly select one of your answers, along with another employer in the study (who is an MTurk worker like you). If your answer matches the other employer's answer for the same applicant, you will receive a bonus of ${{ Constants.bonus_per_part }}.</p>

<p>Complete the following statement to check your understanding before continuing:</p>
{% formfield player.understanding5 label="My bonus for this part of the study depends on whether I" %}
<div style="display:none" id="understanding-attempts-display">{{ player.understanding5_attempts }}</div>
<input type="hidden" name="understanding5_attempts" id="understanding-attempts-submit">
{{ form.understanding5_attempts.errors }}

<button class="btn-primary btn next">Next</button>

<script type="text/javascript">
	document.getElementById('understanding-attempts-submit').value = parseInt(document.getElementById('understanding-attempts-display').innerHTML) + 1;
</script>
