<p>Each applicant portfolio you see will include the applicant's evaluation of their own performance
{% if participant.vars.treatment == 1 %}, along with an avatar representing them
{% elif participant.vars.treatment == 2 %}, an avatar representing them, and the number of application questions that they correctly answered{% endif %}. You'll use this information to choose a valuation for each applicant. These valuations will determine your bonus payment for this part of the study, as explained below:</p>

<p>To determine your bonus for this part of the study, we'll choose one of the applicants you evaluated and randomly pick an amount of money from 1 to 100 cents. If that amount is less than the valuation you chose for the applicant, you will receive a bonus of 10 cents for each job performance question that the applicant answered correctly. Otherwise, you'll just receive the randomly-chosen amount of money. This means that <b>the valuation you choose for each applicant should be the maximum amount you are willing to pay in order to receive 10 cents per job performance correctly answered by that applicant</b>.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>Suppose that you choose a valuation of 60 cents for an applicant. The table below shows your possible bonuses for that applicant:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Random amount is</th>
		<th>Your bonus</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Between 0 and 60 cents</td>
		<td>10 cents times the number of job performance questions that the applicant answered correctly</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Between 61 and 100 cents</td>
		<td>Equal to the random amount</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>

<p>To help you choose good valuations, keep in mind that the average number of application questions correctly answered by a job applicant is {{ Constants.mean_performance }} out of 10.</p>

<p>Complete the following statement to check your understanding before continuing:</p>
