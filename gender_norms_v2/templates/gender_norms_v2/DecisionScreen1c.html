<p>{{ player.name }} is then asked to answer a question in which {{ player.pronoun }} indicated the extent to which {{ player.pronoun }} agreed, on a scale from 0 (entirely disagree) to 100 (entirely agree), with the following statement: “<i>I would succeed in a job that required me to perform well on the test I
took</i>.”</p>

<p>{{ player.name }} submits {{ player.pronoun_possessive }} answer to be considered as part of {{ player.pronoun_possessive }} interview portfolio.<p>

<p>Recall that {{ player.name }} knows that {{ player.pronoun }} answered <b>{{ player.ability_score }} out of 20</b> questions correctly, and that among 100 prior interviews, {{ player.pronoun_possessive }} performance was <b>better than {{ player.ability }}</b> of them and <b>worse than {{ player.ability_comp }}</b> of them.</p>

<br>


<p>TASK: Your task is to rate {{ player.name }}’s self-evaluation decision based on your guess of whether
your <u>MATCH</u> would think that the decision is “socially appropriate” and “consistent with
what most people who are like you would think {{ player.name }} OUGHT to do.” <u>If your rating is the same as your MATCH’s rating, you will earn a bonus of 20 cents</u>.</p>
