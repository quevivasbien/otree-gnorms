<p>In this study, you will play the role of a job applicant.</p>

<p>This study has three parts, meant to simulate a job interview process.</p>

<ul>
	<li>In Part 1, you will take a cognitive ability test consisting of 20 questions as part of the job interview process; Part 1 bonus depends on how well you do in these questions.</li>

	<li>In Part 2, you create your job application portfolio. Based on this portfolio, employers will bid on a wage to pay you for your work in Part 1. The highest bid will be your Part 2 bonus.</li>

	<li>In Part 3, you will make a guess about what wage the employers will offer you and other Mturkers with different job application portfolios. Part 3 bonus depends on how accurately you make these guesses.</li>
</ul>

<p>For completing this study, you are guaranteed to receive $X within 24 hours. You will also receive a bonus payment based on your performance in one randomly selected part out of the three parts. This bonus payment will be up to $X.</p>

<p>This study will have three stages, meant to simulate a job interview process, plus a short follow-up survey. In stage 1, you will take a cognitive ability test consisting of 20 questions as part of the job interview process; in stage 2, you apply to the job. Based on your responses in stage 2, an employer will choose a wage to pay you for your work in stage 1. In stage 3, you will make a guess about what wage the employers will offer you. Stage 1 is the longest stage -- the other two stages should go quickly.</p>

<p>By completing this study, you will receive a guaranteed payment of $X within 24 hours. You will also receive a bonus payment based on your performance in a randomly-selected stage out of one of the three stages. This bonus payment will be up to $X.</p>
