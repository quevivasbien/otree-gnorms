<p>On the next screens, you will read the description of a situation in which a person named {{ player.name }} must make a decision. You will read about the decisions {{ player.name }} faced and what actions {{ player.pronoun }} has to choose between.</p>

<p>Your job is to rate {{ player.name }}’s decision based on whether you think the decision is</p>

<center>
<p>“<u>socially appropriate</u>”</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>“<u>consistent with what most people who are like you think that {{ player.name }} OUGHT to do</u>.”</p>
</center>

<p>By “socially appropriate”, we mean behavior that most people agree is “reasonable” or “correct,” and consistent with proper social behavior in that context</p>

<p>By “socially inappropriate”, we mean behavior that most people agree may make them form a negative impression of {{ player.name }}, thinking, for example, that {{ player.name }} is arrogant, timid, etc., depending on the situation.</p>

<p>That sounds simple, but it is only half the story!</p>

<p>You will only earn the bonus <b>if</b> your “social appropriateness” rating MATCHES the rating of
another Mturker working on this HIT today. We will call this Mturker “your match.” Your match, who is like you, is a US resident who has completed at least 100 tasks on MTurk with a 95% or better approval rating from prior MTurk employers. To increase the chances that you earn the bonus, you should try to imagine what your match, who is like you, would say.</p>

<p>We are ready to start part one: This is where <b>you can earn a bonus</b>!</p>

<p>On the next screens, you will read about the situation that {{ player.name }} is in and the decisions that
{{ player.pronoun }} could makes. The description will include possible actions available to {{ player.name }}.<p>

<p>Your task is to rate {{ player.name }}’s decision based on your guess of whether your MATCH, who is
like you, would think the decision was “socially appropriate” and “consistent with what
someone like you would think {{ player.name }} OUGHT to do.”</p>

<p>Remember that you will only earn bonus if your “social appropriateness” rating is the same
as your MATCH’s rating. For each rating that is the same, you will earn 20 cents (and so will
your match).</p>
